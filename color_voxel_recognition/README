# Library for detecting objects by ColorCHLAC and subspace method.
# works with Kinect

# DEMO 1
1. connect Kinect and "roslaunch openni_camera openni_kinect.launch" -- terminal 1
2. "rosrun topic_tools throttle messages /camera/depth/points2 5" -- terminal 2
3. roscd color_voxel_recognition; cd demos -- terminal 3

     3.1 learn the environment  (necessary for only once)
         "./SH/learn_env.sh"
         Enter for saving data, and "q" for quit

     3.2 learn objects (once for each object)
         "./SH/learn_obj.sh <object_name>"
         Enter for saving data, and "q" for quit

     3.3 detect one object
         "./SH/detect_test.sh <object_name> <similarity_threshold>"


# DEMO 2 (trained from 63 objects)
0. roscd color_feature_classification; cd demos
   set 0.02 for voxel size (color_feature_classification/demos/voxel_size.txt)
   "bash ../scripts/demos/train_models_all.sh"
   bash `rospack find color_voxel_recognition`/scripts/copy_param_and_model.sh 

1. connect Kinect and "roslaunch openni_camera openni_kinect.launch" -- terminal 1
2. "rosrun topic_tools throttle messages /camera/depth/points2 5" -- terminal 2
3. roscd color_voxel_recognition; cd demos_VOSCH -- terminal 3
   bash ../scripts/detect_test.sh 10 0 // 0 for debug
